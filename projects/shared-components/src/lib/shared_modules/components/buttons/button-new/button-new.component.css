/*
1. Component as <BUTTON-new>

We assumed that this component will have <BUTTON-new> as its tag.
The CSS below is written with this in mind

CSS for <BUTTON-new> begin
*/
button-new { display: block; cursor: pointer; width: 2.42857rem; height: 2.57143rem; padding: 0.71429rem 0.64286rem 0.78571rem 0.64286rem; }
button-new .icon.icon-new { display: block; width: 1.07143rem; height: 1.07143rem; }

/* CSS for <BUTTON-new> end */
/*
2. Component with a wrapper DIV around the HTML like <div class="button-new">.

If you need to use <div class="button-new"> to wrap everything in the HTML
of the component, let us know. We'll add/update the CSS to accommodate the requirements.

3. If either option 1 or 2 doesn't work, let us know or the visuals of the component will be broken
